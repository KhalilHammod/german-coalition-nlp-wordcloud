# 🇩🇪 German Coalition Agreement Word Cloud Project

This project uses text mining to analyze the **2025 German coalition agreement** and generate a word cloud highlighting the most frequently used terms — visualized using a custom-shaped map of Germany.

## 🧠 Motivation

Coalition agreements outline a new government's priorities. This project explores their language to uncover emphasized themes such as digital policy, economy, and society — using natural language processing (NLP) and visualization tools.

## 📋 Overview

- Text extracted and processed using Python (`spaCy`, `NLTK`)
- Stopwords removed and terms lemmatized
- Frequencies analyzed and visualized using a word cloud mask

## 📁 Structure

## 🧰 Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `spaCy`, `NLTK`, `WordCloud`, `matplotlib`

## 🖼 Output Preview
