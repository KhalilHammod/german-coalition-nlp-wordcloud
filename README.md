# 🇩🇪 German Coalition Agreement Word Cloud Project

This project applies text mining techniques to examine the 2025 German coalition agreement, creating a word cloud that highlights the most frequently used terms, visualized within a custom-shaped map of Germany.

## 🧠 Motivation

Coalition agreements outline the new German government's priorities. This project analyzes the language of the agreement to provide a high-level overview of the new government's potential policy priorities, using natural language processing (NLP) and visualizations.

## 📋 Overview

- Text extracted and processed using Python (`spaCy`, `NLTK`)
- Stopwords removed and terms lemmatized
- Frequencies analyzed and visualized using a word cloud mask
