# 🇩🇪 German Coalition Agreement Word Cloud Project

This project uses text mining to analyze the **2025 German coalition agreement** and generate a word cloud highlighting the most frequently used words, visualized using a custom-shaped map of Germany.

## 🧠 Motivation

Coalition agreements outline a new government's priorities. This project analyzes the language of the agreement to provide a high-level overview of the new government's potential policy priorities — using natural language processing (NLP) and visualizations.

## 📋 Overview

- Text extracted and processed using Python (`spaCy`, `NLTK`)
- Stopwords removed and terms lemmatized
- Frequencies analyzed and visualized using a word cloud mask
